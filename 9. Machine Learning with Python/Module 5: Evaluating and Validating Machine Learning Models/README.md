# 🤖 Machine Learning with Python – Module 5

**Course:** Machine Learning with Python (Course 9)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 5 focuses on evaluating and validating machine learning models using industry-standard techniques. Learners explore classification and regression metrics, assess model performance with tools like confusion matrices and feature importance charts, and understand how to measure clustering quality in unsupervised learning scenarios.

The module also introduces cross-validation to reduce overfitting, regularization to improve generalization, and end-to-end machine learning pipelines optimized with GridSearchCV. Common pitfalls, including data leakage, are addressed to ensure robust and reliable model development. A supporting cheat sheet provides key evaluation metrics, techniques, and model tuning strategies.

> This module equips learners to critically assess models, optimize pipelines, and implement best practices in machine learning evaluation.
