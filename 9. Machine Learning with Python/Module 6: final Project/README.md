# 🤖 Module 6: Machine Learning with Python 

**Course:** Machine Learning with Python (Course 9)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 6 is the final module of the course, where learners apply and consolidate the full range of machine learning skills acquired in previous modules. Learners engage in hands-on practice with the Titanic dataset to build, optimize, and evaluate classification models using pipelines, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

The module then progresses to a final project focused on rainfall prediction using historical weather data. Learners perform data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation. The course concludes with a graded final exam that assesses knowledge across all six modules.

> This module enables learners to demonstrate both practical and theoretical mastery of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
