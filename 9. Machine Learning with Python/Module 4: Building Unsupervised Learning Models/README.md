# 🤖 Module 4: Machine Learning with Python 

**Course:** Machine Learning with Python (Course 9)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 4 introduces unsupervised learning techniques to discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Learners explore clustering methods, including K-Means for customer segmentation, and advanced density-based models such as DBSCAN and HDBSCAN for identifying clusters in spatial datasets.

The module also covers dimensionality reduction methods to simplify high-dimensional datasets. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and UMAP are applied to interpret and visualize complex data structures. A supporting cheat sheet provides key methods, practical use cases, and comparisons for unsupervised learning.

> This module equips learners with the ability to uncover patterns, segment data, and reduce dimensionality for effective analysis in unsupervised learning scenarios.
