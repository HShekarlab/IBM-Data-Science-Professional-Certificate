# 🤖 Module 2: Machine Learning with Python 

**Course:** Machine Learning with Python (Course 9)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 2 introduces two key regression techniques in machine learning: linear and logistic regression. Learners explore how regression models are applied to predict continuous outcomes and understand the differences between simple and multiple linear regression. The module also demonstrates the use of polynomial and non-linear regression for capturing complex patterns in data.

In addition, logistic regression is introduced as a method for classification problems. Practical exercises using scikit-learn enable learners to train and test both regression and classification models on real-world datasets. A cheat sheet summarizing formulas and key concepts supports hands-on learning.

> This module equips learners with essential regression skills needed for predictive modeling in machine learning workflows.
