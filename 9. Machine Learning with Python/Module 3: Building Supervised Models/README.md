# 🤖 Module 3: Machine Learning with Python 

**Course:** Machine Learning with Python (Course 9)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 focuses on building and evaluating supervised machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. Learners explore how classification models predict categorical outcomes, implement multi-class strategies, and apply decision tree models for both types of problems.

The module covers advanced algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM) for fraud detection, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for customer segmentation, and ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost. Learners gain insights into bias-variance trade-offs and how ensemble techniques improve model accuracy and robustness. A cheat sheet summarizing key terms, model types, and evaluation tips supports applied learning.

> This module empowers learners to build practical supervised ML models and evaluate them for performance and reliability.
