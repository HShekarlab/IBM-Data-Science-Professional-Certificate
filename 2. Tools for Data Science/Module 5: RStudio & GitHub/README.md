## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 5 combines statistical programming with collaborative software development practices. The module introduces R as a powerful language for data analysis and manipulation, along with the RStudio environment used to develop and run R code efficiently. Learners explore data visualization concepts in R and create graphical outputs using built-in plotting capabilities.

In addition, the module covers distributed version control concepts and focuses on Git and GitHub as essential tools for modern data science workflows. Learners gain both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience with repositories, commits, branches, pull requests, and collaborative development practices, culminating in a practical project.

> This module bridges data analysis and collaboration by integrating programming, visualization, and version control skills.
