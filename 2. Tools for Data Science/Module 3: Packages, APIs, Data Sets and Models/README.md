# 📦 Module 3: Tools for Data Science  

**Course:** Tools for Data Science (Course 2)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 introduces core software components and resources commonly used in data science workflows. Learners explore widely used libraries across scientific computing, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning, and gain a practical understanding of how these libraries support model development.

The module also explains how APIs function within data science systems, with a focus on REST-based request and response patterns. In addition, learners examine open data resources and discover how pre-built machine learning models can be leveraged to solve real-world problems using model repositories.

> This module connects tooling, data resources, and models into a cohesive view of applied data science.
