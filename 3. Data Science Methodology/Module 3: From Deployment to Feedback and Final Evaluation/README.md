# 🚀 Data Science Methodology – Module 3

**Course:** Data Science Methodology (Course 3)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 covers the Deployment and Feedback stages of the data science methodology. Learners focus on evaluating when a model is ready for deployment, understanding the stakeholders involved, and establishing iterative feedback loops to refine and improve model performance.

The module includes hands-on labs where learners apply methodology principles to business problems related to email, hospitals, or credit cards. Through practical exercises, learners demonstrate their understanding of the CRISP-DM phases, while AI-graded submissions provide rapid, precise feedback on their work.

> This module emphasizes the iterative nature of deploying models and incorporating stakeholder feedback to optimize real-world outcomes.
