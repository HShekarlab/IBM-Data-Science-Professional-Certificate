# 🧩 Data Science Methodology – Module 2

**Course:** Data Science Methodology (Course 3)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 2 focuses on the stages of Data Understanding, Data Preparation, and Modeling and Evaluation within the data science methodology. Learners explore practical approaches for cleaning and preparing datasets, managing missing or inconsistent data, and applying data modeling techniques.

The module provides hands-on labs to reinforce concepts and allow learners to practice preparing datasets, handling invalid or misleading data, and evaluating models. Realistic examples, including building decision trees for classification tasks, allow learners to connect methodology principles to practical applications.

> This module emphasizes translating data science methodology into actionable skills for preparing, modeling, and evaluating data.
