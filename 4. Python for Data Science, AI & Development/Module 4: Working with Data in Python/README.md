## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 4 introduces learners to fundamental data handling and manipulation techniques in Python. The module covers reading and writing files in formats such as text, CSV, and JSON, and emphasizes efficient file operations for real-world data tasks.

Learners also explore essential Python libraries for data analysis, including Pandas for structured data in tabular form and NumPy for numerical operations on arrays and matrices. Hands-on exercises provide opportunities to load, access, manipulate, and perform computations on datasets, establishing a strong foundation for more advanced data analysis techniques.

> This module equips learners with practical skills for working with data efficiently in Python using powerful libraries and file handling capabilities.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Open and read text files using Python’s `open()` and `read()` functions.  
2. Create and write data to files, including appending without overwriting existing content.  
3. Load data into Pandas using DataFrames and apply basic data handling techniques.  
4. Manipulate and save data in Pandas DataFrames for analysis.  
5. Access and explore data in Pandas with various DataFrame methods.  
6. Select and manipulate data within DataFrames using `loc()` and `iloc()`.  
7. Utilize NumPy to create and manipulate one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.  
8. Perform indexing, slicing, and mathematical computations on NumPy arrays.
