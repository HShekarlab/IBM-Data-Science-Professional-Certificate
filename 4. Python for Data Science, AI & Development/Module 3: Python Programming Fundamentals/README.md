**Course:** Python for Data Science, AI & Development (Course 4)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 builds a strong foundation in core Python programming concepts essential for applied data science. Learners explore conditions and branching, loops, functions, exception handling, and object-oriented programming principles.

Hands-on labs provide opportunities to practice controlling program flow, performing iterative tasks, defining and applying functions, managing errors, and creating classes and objects. This module prepares learners to structure, reuse, and maintain Python code effectively for data science applications.

> This module emphasizes building robust Python programs and understanding object-oriented principles for applied data science.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with specific outputs.  
2. Describe the use of comparison operators, logical operators, and branching statements in Python.  
3. Explain how for loops and while loops work and when to use each.  
4. Create and use loop statements to perform iterative tasks.  
5. Define and use Python functions, including built-in and user-defined functions with inputs, outputs, loops, and variable scope.  
6. Build and apply Python functions using appropriate variables and return statements.  
7. Utilize exception handling constructs to manage errors during program execution.  
8. Explain the concepts of objects and classes, understanding Python data types and their internal structure.  
9. Work with Python classes and objects by defining attributes, methods, and creating class instances.  
10. Apply condition statements, operators, and branching in Python programs.
