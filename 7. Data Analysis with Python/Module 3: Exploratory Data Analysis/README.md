# 📊 Module 3: Data Analysis with Python 

**Course:** Data Analysis with Python (Course 7)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 focuses on building foundational skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. Learners compute descriptive statistics, analyze data distributions, and visualize patterns to better understand datasets.

Hands-on exercises include grouping data, calculating correlations using the Pearson method, applying chi-square tests for categorical variables, and interpreting results. The module uses real-world datasets such as Laptop and Used Car Pricing datasets and includes a cheat sheet for quick reference.

> This module emphasizes applying EDA techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in datasets before further analysis.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the role of EDA in understanding dataset structure, patterns, and outliers.  
2. Interpret summary statistics to describe central tendency and spread.  
3. Use Pandas `groupby()` to compare aggregated statistics across categories.  
4. Select and generate appropriate visualizations for distributions and relationships.  
5. Identify relationships between two continuous variables using correlation coefficients.  
6. Explain and apply the Pearson correlation coefficient.  
7. Use the chi-square test to evaluate dependency between categorical variables.  
8. Perform EDA on the Used Car Pricing dataset.  
9. Apply EDA techniques to the Laptop Pricing dataset to uncover trends, outliers, and relationships.
