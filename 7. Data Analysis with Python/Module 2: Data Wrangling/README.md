# 📊 Module 2: Data Analysis with Python 

**Course:** Data Analysis with Python (Course 7)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 2 focuses on enhancing data wrangling skills in Python. Learners practice cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis using real-world examples such as the Laptop and Used Car Pricing datasets.

Hands-on labs teach techniques to handle missing values, normalize and format data, bin numerical variables, and convert categorical variables into numerical representations. A cheat sheet is provided as a quick reference throughout the learning process.

> This module emphasizes mastering data pre-processing and transformation workflows in Python for practical analysis tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Describe key steps in the data pre-processing pipeline.  
2. Clean datasets by handling missing values using Pandas.  
3. Convert data types to correct inconsistencies in datasets.  
4. Normalize numeric variables using min-max scaling and Z-score transformations.  
5. Create bins for continuous variables to support categorical grouping.  
6. Transform categorical variables into numerical representations (label encoding, one-hot encoding).  
7. Execute full data wrangling workflows on the Used Cars Pricing dataset.  
8. Apply data cleaning and transformation to the Laptop Pricing dataset.
