# 📊 Data Analysis with Python – Module 4

**Course:** Data Analysis with Python (Course 7)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 4 focuses on the fundamentals of model development in Python-based data analysis. Learners build, visualize, and evaluate regression models—including simple linear, multiple linear, and polynomial regression—while implementing pipelines to streamline workflows.

Hands-on exercises utilize real-world datasets like used car and laptop pricing, and learners assess model performance using metrics and visualizations such as residual plots and KDE plots. A cheat sheet is included for quick reference during model-building and evaluation.

> This module emphasizes practical regression modeling skills and performance evaluation for predictive data analysis.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the machine learning modeling process and identify dependent and independent variables.  
2. Apply simple and multiple linear regression using sklearn.  
3. Interpret residual plots and regression score visualizations to assess model fit.  
4. Use polynomial regression and Pipelines to model nonlinear relationships.  
5. Analyze predicted versus actual distributions with KDE plots.  
6. Calculate and interpret R-squared and MSE to evaluate model performance.  
7. Use regression predictions to support data-driven decisions (e.g., pricing, forecasting).  
8. Develop and evaluate regression models for used car pricing.  
9. Build and test predictive models for laptop pricing using Python.
