# 📊 Module 5: Data Analysis with Python 

**Course:** Data Analysis with Python (Course 7)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 5 focuses on refining predictive modeling skills in Python by evaluating, tuning, and selecting models for optimal performance. Learners explore overfitting, underfitting, hyperparameter tuning, and ridge regression to regularize models and improve generalization.

Hands-on labs apply these concepts to real-world datasets such as used car and laptop pricing data, allowing learners to build robust models. A cheat sheet guides the choice of techniques, tools, and evaluation metrics for model optimization.

> This module emphasizes model selection, tuning, and regularization for building accurate and generalizable predictive models.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Interpret training and testing scores to evaluate model generalization.  
2. Differentiate between overfitting and underfitting, and apply strategies based on bias-variance trade-off.  
3. Explain ridge regression and how it reduces overfitting using regularization.  
4. Apply ridge regression in Python and compare it with standard linear regression.  
5. Use grid search for hyperparameter tuning and selecting the best model configuration.  
6. Evaluate and refine used car pricing models through model comparison and parameter tuning.  
7. Optimize laptop pricing models using ridge regression and grid search to improve accuracy.
