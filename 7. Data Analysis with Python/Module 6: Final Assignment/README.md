# 📊 Module 6: Data Analysis with Python 

**Course:** Data Analysis with Python (Course 7)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 6 is the capstone module where learners apply the complete data analysis workflow in Python. This includes importing, cleaning, transforming data, and building and evaluating predictive models on real-world datasets.

Hands-on practice and final projects use insurance cost and housing price datasets. Learners assume the role of a Data Analyst at a real estate investment trust, analyzing property features and predicting housing market values. The final project notebook submission is AI-graded, consolidating skills and preparing learners for real-world data analysis scenarios.

> This module emphasizes applying end-to-end data analysis techniques and evaluating models for actionable insights.
