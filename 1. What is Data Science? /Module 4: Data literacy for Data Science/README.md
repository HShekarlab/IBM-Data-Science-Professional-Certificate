**Platform:** Coursera  
**Module Duration:** Optional Module  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 4 serves as an optional extension to the foundational material covered in earlier modules and emphasizes the importance of **data literacy** and understanding the broader **data ecosystem**.  
As data scientists work with increasingly diverse and complex datasets, it becomes essential to understand how data is produced, stored, organized, and accessed within modern systems.

The module introduces the fundamental concepts behind data types and formats, storage technologies, and large-scale data environments.  
Lesson one focuses on how data originates and flows through systems, while lesson two explores repositories and infrastructure designed to manage high-volume datasets.

> This module reinforces foundational knowledge of the data landscape—an essential component of effective and informed data science practice.
