# 🚀 Applied Data Science Capstone – Module 3

**Course:** Applied Data Science Capstone (Course 10)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 3 focuses on **building interactive dashboards and maps** to visualize and analyze Falcon 9 launch data. Learners use Plotly Dash to create dashboards with pie charts and scatter plots, allowing interactive exploration of launch records. Additionally, Folium is used to generate interactive maps to examine launch site proximities and plot clusters of launch activity.  

This module emphasizes **hands-on visualization and spatial analysis** to support deeper insights into launch performance and site data.

> Learners will gain practical experience creating interactive, user-friendly dashboards and maps that can inform real-world decision-making.
