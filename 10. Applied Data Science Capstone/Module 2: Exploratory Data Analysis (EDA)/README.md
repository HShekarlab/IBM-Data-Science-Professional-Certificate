# 🚀 Applied Data Science Capstone – Module 2

**Course:** Applied Data Science Capstone (Course 10)  
**Platform:** Coursera  

---

## 🔹 Module Overview
Module 2 focuses on **data collection and wrangling** for the Falcon 9 first-stage landing project. Learners explore methods to gather data from multiple sources, including RESTful APIs and web scraping techniques. Once collected, the data is converted into Pandas DataFrames for cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.  

This module provides practical experience in preparing real-world datasets for subsequent modeling and analysis steps.

> The emphasis is on developing robust data collection and wrangling workflows to support predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in Pandas DataFrames.  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) by manipulating data in Pandas.  
3. Write and execute SQL queries to select, sort, and summarize data.  
4. Utilize visualization techniques to extract meaningful patterns and guide the modeling process.
